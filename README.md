# lcd Algorithm
LCD: Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks with Layered Clustering and Degree.

# state-of-the-art Method
Including, Degree Rank, Cluster Rank, Vote Rank, Vote Rank ++, 
k-sheel, H-index

# Mertics Used
1. $$F(t) =\frac{ n_{I(t)} + n_{R(t)}}{n}$$
2. $$F(t_c) =\frac{ n_{R(t_c)}}{n}$$
3. $$L_s = \frac{1}{|S|(|S|-1)} \sum_{u, v \in S, u \neq v} d(u, v)$$

# Run

For each metric, change the network and then run for example
python ft.py
